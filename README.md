# TetrixBot

This is bot for Tetrix. Original task is https://khcup.dots.org.ua/dots/problems?id=1432&cid=66.

Also here is provided some approach for improving simple bots.
Current state: bot destroys ~1500 lines on random tests. I want to create a visualizer as a web page. Also in the future this bot could be improved by NeuralNetwork (to choose better weights than I have chosen)  

Current status:

I am going to use Neural Network to make weights better. I know a bit what it шы, but I have never written this. Today (tomorrow) is the time to change that. I am hope I will have some results)
